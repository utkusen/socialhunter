> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool is no longer working, and we won't be able to fix it as it has become difficult to bypass social media protections.

Crawls the given URL and finds broken social media links that can be hijacked. Broken social links may allow an attacker to conduct phishing attacks. It also can cost a loss of the company's reputation. Broken social media hijack issues are usually accepted on the bug bounty programs.

Currently, it supports Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok without any API keys.

# Usage

socialhunter requires 2 parameters to run: 

`-f` : Path of the text file that contains URLs line by line. The crawl function is path-aware. For example, if the URL is `https://utkusen.com/blog`, it only crawls the pages under `/blog` path

`-w` : The number of workers to run (e.g `-w 10`). The default value is 5. You can increase or decrease this by testing out the capability of your system.
